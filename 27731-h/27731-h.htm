	<h2>I</h2>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p class="i2">Celia was laughing. Hopefully I said:</p>
	<p>“How shall this beauty that we share,</p>
	<p>This love, remain aware</p>
	<p>Beyond our happy breathing of the air?</p>
	<p>How shall it be fulfilled and perfected?...</p>
	<p>If you were dead,</p>
	<p>How then should I be comforted?”</p>
	<p class="i2">But Celia knew instead:</p>
	<p>“He who finds beauty here, shall find it there.”</p>
	<p class="i2">A halo gathered round her hair.</p>
	<p>I looked and saw her wisdom bare</p>
	<p>The living bosom of the countless dead.</p>
	<p>... And there</p>
	<p>I laid my head.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">Again when Celia laughed, I doubted her and said:</p>
		<p>“Life must be led</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>In many ways more difficult to see</p>
		<p>Than this immediate way</p>
		<p>For you and me.</p>
		<p>We stand together on our lake’s edge, and the mystery</p>
		<p>Of love has made us one, as day is made of night and night of day.</p>
		<p>Aware of one identity</p>
		<p>Within each other, we can say:</p>
		<p>‘I shall be everything you are.’...</p>
		<p>We are uplifted till we touch a star.</p>
		<p>We know that overhead</p>
		<p>Is nothing more austere, more starry, or more deep to understand</p>
		<p>Than is our union, human hand in hand.</p>
		<p>.... But over our lake come strangers—a crowded launch, a lonely sailing boy.</p>
		<p>A mile away a train bends by. In every car</p>
		<p>Strangers are travelling, each with particular</p>
		<p>And unkind preference like ours, with privacy</p>
		<p>Of understanding, with especial joy</p>
		<p>Like ours. Celia, Celia, why should there be</p>
		<p>Distrust between ourselves and them, disunity?</p>
		<p>.... How careful we have been</p>
		<p>To trim this little circle that we tread,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>To set a bar</p>
		<p>To strangers and forbid them!—Are they not as we,</p>
		<p>Our very likeness and our nearest kin?</p>
		<p>How can we shut them out and let stars in?”</p>
		<p class="i2">She looked along the lake. And when I heard her speak,</p>
		<p>The sun fell on the boy’s white sail and her white cheek.</p>
		<p>“I touch them all through you,” she said. “I cannot know them now</p>
		<p>Deeply and truly as my very own, except through you,</p>
		<p>Except through one or two</p>
		<p>Interpreters.</p>
		<p>But not a moment stirs</p>
		<p>Here between us, binding and interweaving us,</p>
		<p>That does not bind these others to our care.”</p>
		<p class="i2">The sunlight fell in glory on her hair....</p>
		<p>And then said Celia, radiant, when I held her near:</p>
		<p>“They who find beauty there, shall find it here.”</p>
		<p class="i2">And on her brow,</p>
		<p>When I heard Celia speak,</p>
		<p>Cities were populous</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>With peace and oceans echoed glories in her ear</p>
		<p>And from her risen thought</p>
		<p>Her lips had brought,</p>
		<p>As from some peak</p>
		<p>Down through the clouds, a mountain-air</p>
		<p>To guide the lonely and uplift the weak.</p>
		<p class="i2">“Record it all,” she told me, “more than merely this,</p>
		<p>More than the shine of sunset on our heads, more than a kiss,</p>
		<p>More than our rapt agreement and delight</p>
		<p>Watching the mountain mingle with the night....</p>
		<p>Tell that the love of two incurs</p>
		<p>The love of multitudes, makes way</p>
		<p>And welcome for them, as a solitary star</p>
		<p>Brings on the great array.</p>
		<p>Go make a lovers’ calendar,”</p>
		<p>She said, “for every day.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">And when the sun had put away</p>
		<p>His dazzle, over the shadowy firs</p>
		<p>The solitary star came out.... So on some night</p>
		<p>To eyes of youth shall come my light</p>
		<p>And hers.</p>
	</div>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>II</h2>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">“Where are you bound, O solemn voyager?”</p>
		<p>She laughed one day and asked me in her mirth:</p>
		<p>“Where are you from?</p>
		<p>Why are you come?”</p>
		<p>.... The questions beat like tapping of a drum;</p>
		<p>And how could I be dumb,</p>
		<p>I who have bugles in me? Fast</p>
		<p>The answer blew to her,</p>
		<p>For all my breath was worth....</p>
		<p>“As a bird comes by grace of spring,</p>
		<p>You are my journey and my wing—</p>
		<p>And into your heart, O Celia,</p>
		<p>My heart has flown, to sing</p>
		<p>Solemn and long</p>
		<p>A most undaunted song.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>This was the song that she herself had taught me how to sing:</p>
		<p>.... As immigrants come toward America</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>On their continual ships out of the past,</p>
		<p>So on my ship America have I, by birth,</p>
		<p>Come forth at last</p>
		<p>From all the bitter corners of the earth.</p>
		<p>And I have ears to hear the westward wind blowing</p>
		<p>And I have eyes to look beyond the scope Of sea</p>
		<p>And I have hands to touch the hands</p>
		<p>Of shipmates who are going</p>
		<p>Wherever I go and the grace of knowing</p>
		<p>That what for them is hope</p>
		<p>Is hope for me.</p>
		<p>I come from many times and many lands,</p>
		<p>I look toward life and all that it shall hold,</p>
		<p>Past bound and past divide.</p>
		<p>And I shall be consoled</p>
		<p>By a continent as wide</p>
		<p>As the round invisible sky.</p>
		<p>.... “The unseen shall become the seen....</p>
		<p>O Celia, be my Spanish Queen!</p>
		<p>The Genoan am I!”</p>
		<p class="i2">And Celia cried:</p>
		<p>“My jewels, they are yours,</p>
		<p>Yours for the journey. Use them well.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>Go find the new world, win the shores</p>
		<p>Of which the old books tell!</p>
		<p>.... Yet will they listen, poet? Will they sail with you?</p>
		<p>Will they not call you dreamer of a dream?</p>
		<p>Will they not laugh at you, because you seem</p>
		<p>Concerned with words that people often say</p>
		<p>And deeds they never do?”</p>
		<p class="i2">The bright sails of my caravel shook seaward in reply:</p>
		<p>“Though I be told</p>
		<p>A thousand facts to hold</p>
		<p>Me back, though the old boundary</p>
		<p>Rise up like hatred in my way,</p>
		<p>Though fellow-voyagers cry,</p>
		<p>‘A lie!’—</p>
		<p>Here as I come with heaven at my side</p>
		<p>None of the weary words they say</p>
		<p>Remain with me,</p>
		<p>I am borne like a wave of the sea</p>
		<p>Toward worlds to be....</p>
		<p>And, young and bold,</p>
		<p>I am happier than they—</p>
		<p>The timid unbelievers who grow old!”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>She interceded: “How impatient, how unkind</p>
		<p>You are! What secret do you know</p>
		<p>To keep you young?</p>
		<p>Age comes with keen and accurate advance</p>
		<p>Against youth’s lightly handled lance.</p>
		<p>Age is an ancient despot that has wrung</p>
		<p>All hearts.”... My answer was the song forever sung:</p>
		<p>“This that I need to know I know—</p>
		<p>Onpouring and perpetual immigrants,</p>
		<p>We join a fellowship beyond America</p>
		<p>Yet in America....</p>
		<p>Beyond the touch of age, my Celia,</p>
		<p>In you, in me, in everyone, we join God’s growing mind.</p>
		<p>For in no separate place or time, or soul, we find</p>
		<p>Our meaning. In one mingled soul reside</p>
		<p>All times and places. On a tide</p>
		<p>Of mist and azure air</p>
		<p>We journey toward that soul, through circumstance,</p>
		<p>Until at last we fully care and dare</p>
		<p>To make within ourselves divinity.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>“And what of all the others,” Celia said,</p>
		<p>“Who ventured brave as you? What of the dead?”</p>
		<p class="i2">Again I saw the halo in her hair</p>
		<p>And said: “The dead sail forward, hid behind</p>
		<p>This wave that we ourselves must mount to find</p>
		<p>The eternal way.</p>
		<p>Adventurers of long ago</p>
		<p>Seeking a richer gain than earthy gold,</p>
		<p>They have left for us, half-told,</p>
		<p>Their guesses of the port, more numerous and blind</p>
		<p>Than their unnumbered and forgotten faces.</p>
		<p>... And though today, as then,</p>
		<p>Death is a wind blowing them forward out of sight and out of mind,</p>
		<p>Yet in familiar and in unfamiliar places</p>
		<p>Inquiring by what means I may</p>
		<p>The destination of the wind</p>
		<p>Of death, I have found signs and traces</p>
		<p>Of the way they go</p>
		<p>And with a quicker heart I have beheld again</p>
		<p>In visions, from my ship at sea,</p>
		<p>The great new world confronting me,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>Where, yesterday,</p>
		<p>Today, tomorrow, dwell my countrymen.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">And then I looked away,</p>
		<p>Over the pasture and the valley, to the New Hampshire town....</p>
		<p>And my heart’s acclaim went down,</p>
		<p>To Florida, Wisconsin, California,</p>
		<p>And brought a good report to Celia:</p>
		<p>“My ship America,</p>
		<p>This whole wide-timbered land,</p>
		<p>Well captained and well manned,</p>
		<p>Ascends the sea</p>
		<p>Of time, carrying me</p>
		<p>And many passengers.</p>
		<p>And every cabin stirs</p>
		<p>With the pulsing of its engine over the sway of time,</p>
		<p>Yes, every state and city, every village, every farm,</p>
		<p>And every heart and everyone’s right arm.</p>
		<p>... Celia, hold out your hand,</p>
		<p>Or anyone in any field or street, hold out your hand—</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>And I can see it pulse the massive climb</p>
		<p>And dip</p>
		<p>Of this America,</p>
		<p>My ship!”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">“Why make your ship so small?</p>
		<p>Can your America contain them all?”</p>
		<p class="i2">How wisely I replied</p>
		<p>In the province of my pride:</p>
		<p>“But these are my own shipmates, these</p>
		<p>Who share my ship America with me!</p>
		<p>... On many seas</p>
		<p>On other ships, even the ancient ships of Greece,</p>
		<p>Have other immigrants set sail for peace.</p>
		<p>But these are my own shipmates whom I see</p>
		<p>At hand—these are my company.”</p>
		<p class="i2">“What have you said,” she cried,</p>
		<p>“Thinking you knew?</p>
		<p>Whom have you called your shipmates? You were wrong!</p>
		<p>Your ship is strong</p>
		<p>With a more various crew</p>
		<p>Than any one man’s country could provide,</p>
		<p>To make it ride</p>
		<p>So high and manifold and so complete.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>This is the engine-beat</p>
		<p>Of life itself, the ship of ships.</p>
		<p>There is no other ship among the stars than this.</p>
		<p>The wind of death is a bright kiss</p>
		<p>Upon the lips</p>
		<p>Of every immigrant, as upon yours and mine—</p>
		<p>Theirs is the stinging brine</p>
		<p>And sun and open sea,</p>
		<p>And theirs the arching sky, eternity.”</p>
		<p class="i2">And Celia had my homage. I was wrong.</p>
		<p>Immigrants all, one ship we ride,</p>
		<p>Man and his bride</p>
		<p>The journey through.</p>
		<p>O let it be with a bridal-song!...</p>
		<p>“My shipmates are as many as eternity is long:</p>
		<p>The unborn and the living and the dead—</p>
		<p>And, Celia, you!”</p>
	</div>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>III</h2>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">That midnight when the moon was tall</p>
		<p>I walked alone by the white lake—yet with a vanished race</p>
		<p>And with a race to come. To walk with dead men is to pray,</p>
		<p>To walk with men unborn—to find the way.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">I have seen many days. That night I watched them all.</p>
		<p>I have seen many a sign and trace</p>
		<p>Of beauty and of hope:</p>
		<p>An elm at night; an arrowy waterfall;</p>
		<p>The illimitable round unbroken scope</p>
		<p>Of life; a friend’s unfrightened dying face.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">Though I have heard the cry of fear in crowded loneliness of space,</p>
		<p>Dead laughter from the lips of lust,</p>
		<p>Anger from fools, falsehood from sycophants,</p>
		<p>(My fear, my lips, my anger, my disgrace)</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>Though I have held a golden cup and tasted rust,</p>
		<p>Seen cities rush to be defiled</p>
		<p>By the bright-fevered and consuming sin</p>
		<p>Of making only coin and lives to count it in,</p>
		<p>Yet once I watched with Celia,</p>
		<p>Watched on a ferry an Italian child,</p>
		<p>One whom America</p>
		<p>Had changed.</p>
		<p>His cheek was hardy and his mouth was frail</p>
		<p>For sweetness, and his eyes were opening wild</p>
		<p>As with wonder at an unseen figure carrying a grail.</p>
		<p class="i2">Perhaps he faced, as I did in his glance,</p>
		<p>The spirit of the living dead who, having ranged</p>
		<p>Through long reverses, forward without fail</p>
		<p>Carry deliverance</p>
		<p>From privilege and disinheritance,</p>
		<p>Until their universal soul shall prove</p>
		<p>The only answer to the ache of love.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">“America was wistful in that child,”</p>
		<p>Said Celia afterwards—and smiled</p>
		<p>Because all three of us were immigrants,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>Each voyaging into each.</p>
		<p class="i2">Over the city-roofs, the sun awoke</p>
		<p>Bright in the dew</p>
		<p>Of a marvellous morning, while she spoke</p>
		<p>Of the sun, the dew, the wonder, in a child:</p>
		<p>“He who devises tyranny,” she said,</p>
		<p>“Denies the resurrection of the dead,</p>
		<p>Beneath his own degree degrades himself,</p>
		<p>Invades himself with ugliness and wars.</p>
		<p>But he who knows all men to be himself,</p>
		<p>Part of his own experiment and reach,</p>
		<p>Humbles and amplifies himself</p>
		<p>To build and share a tenement of stars.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">Once when we broke a loaf of bread</p>
		<p>And shared the honey, Celia said:</p>
		<p>“To share all beauty as the interchanging dust,</p>
		<p>To be akin and kind and to entrust</p>
		<p>All men to one another for their good,</p>
		<p>Is to have heard and understood,</p>
		<p>And carried to the common enemy</p>
		<p>In you and me,</p>
		<p>The ultimatum of democracy.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>“But to what goal?” I wondered. And I heard her happy speech:</p>
		<p>“It is my faith that God is our own dream</p>
		<p>Of perfect understanding of the soul.</p>
		<p>It is my passion that, alike through me</p>
		<p>And every member of eternity,</p>
		<p>The source of God is sending the same stream.</p>
		<p>It is my peace that when my life is whole,</p>
		<p>God’s life shall be completed and supreme.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">And once when I had made complaint</p>
		<p>About America, she warned me: “Be not faint</p>
		<p>Of heart, but bold to see the soul’s advance.</p>
		<p>The chances are not far nor few....</p>
		<p>Face beauty,” Celia said, “then beauty faces you.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i2">And under all things her advice was true.</p>
		<p>... Discovering what she knew,</p>
		<p>Not only on a mountainous place</p>
		<p>Or by the solving sea</p>
		<p>But through the world I have seen endless beauty, as the number grows</p>
		<p>Of those who, in a child cheated of simple joy</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>Or in a wasted rose</p>
		<p>Or in a lover’s immemorial lonely eyes</p>
		<p>Or in machines that quicken and destroy</p>
		<p>A multitude or in a mother’s unregarded grace</p>
		<p>And broken heart, through all the skies</p>
		<p>And all humanity,</p>
		<p>Seek out the single spirit, face to face,</p>
		<p>Find it, become a conscious part of it</p>
